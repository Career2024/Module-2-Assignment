        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare sushi rice by mixing cooked short-grain rice with seasoned vinegar.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut both ends of the cucumber and peel it. Now cut it in half lengthwise and repeat to get 4 strips. Remove the seeds and cut again to get 8 pieces in total.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cut out thin slices of raw tuna, about ¼- ½ inches thick. Make long stripes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Place the bamboo mat on a flat surface and cover it with a plastic sheet. Now put the Nori sheet on the bamboo mat. Remember that the rough side4of the Nori should face towards you.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Moisten your hands. Take a medium ball of sushi rice in your hands and spread an even layer on the Nori. Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure and keep a half-inch space on all sides</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now add cucumber and tuna strips in the middle section of the rice. If the tuna or cucumber pieces are short, you may add extra pieces lined up to cover the Nori sheet’s length.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Roll the bamboo mat away from you to create a tight and compact log. Keep pressing slightly as you roll to ensure that the ingredients stick together properly. Apply a few drops of water on the edges and seal it.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Moisten the knife and cut the roll into 6-8 pieces. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi. Repeat the steps for the remaining ingredients.</p>

     <h2>How to Make Shish Kabobs
</h2>
  <p>To make shish kebabs, make sure you give yourself enough time to allow the meat to marinate for the best flavor. Two to four hours is ideal, but 30 minutes does the trick if you’re short on time. Here’s how to make shish kabobs:</p>

        <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>Ingredients</th>

        <h3>At Least 1 ½ Hours Before Cooking: Marinate the Shish Kebabs</h3>
        <ul class="prep">
            <li>Prep Time: 20 mins</li>
            <li>Cook Time: 25 mins</li>
            <li>Serves: 4</li>
            <li>Total Time: 16 hrs</li>
            <li>Cal/Serv: 626</li>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Make the spice rub.</strong> In a large bowl, mix together 2 ½ teaspoons garlic powder, 1 ½ teaspoons nutmeg, 1 ½ teaspoons cardamom, 1 teaspoon allspice, 1 teaspoon paprika, and a very generous pinch or two of kosher salt and black pepper.</li><br> 
<li><strong>Season the meat.</strong> Cut 3 pounds of steak (I use beef tenderloin) into 1 ½-inch cubes. Add the meat to the bowl with the spice rub and use your hands to rub the spices into the meat, coating it in the spices.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the marinade.</strong> Thinly slice one red onion and add to a large, deep baking dish or Tupperware container. Juice in two lemons and add 1 cup each of olive oil and red wine. </li><br>
            <li><strong>Marinate the meat</strong>. Add the seasoned meat and use your hands to work the marinade into the meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (preferably 2 to 4 hours, or overnight for a tougher cut of steak).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>One Hour Before Grilling: Get Ready to Grill
</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Get ready</strong>. Remove the meat from your fridge for one hour before grilling. If you’re using bamboo or wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least one hour to prevent sticking. Cut one red onion and 4 bell peppers (a mixture of red, green, and yellow) into pieces that are roughly the same width as the meat. 
</li><br>
  </ul>
  <h3>30 Minutes Before Serving: Grill the Shish Kebabs
</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Preheat your grill.</strong> Lightly oil the grates of a gas grill and heat for 10 minutes on high.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Prepare the skewers.</strong> Thread the meat, onion pieces (discard the slices from the marinade as they’ll be too thin), and bell peppers onto the prepared skewers. Alternate until you run out of meat–I do about 4 pieces of meat per skewer with the vegetables nestled in between. Hold onto the marinade as we’ll use it later. Season the skewers with more freshly ground black pepper.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Grill.</strong> Place the shish kabobs on the grill. Cook, turning occasionally and brushing the meat a couple of times with the marinade as you go. They’ll be done in 8 to 10 minutes, depending on how hot your grill is and how well-cooked you like your meat.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Rest before serving.</strong> Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving platter. Allow 5 minutes for the kabobs to rest before serving. Enjoy!</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add a little bit of oil and salt to the boiling water and cook the linguine according to package instructions.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, season the shrimp with salt and pepper and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Add the butter and olive oil to an extra-large skillet over medium-low. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, being careful not to burn it. 
</li><br>
        <li>Add the shrimp and sauté just until they turn pink, about 4-5 minutes, tossing often.
</li><br>
        <li>Remove from the heat and add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. 
</li><br>
        <li>Toss to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.
</li><br>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked, drain the water and add the noodles to the sauté pan. 
</li><br>
        <li>Top with fresh parmesan cheese and toss everything gently to combine. Serve.</li><br>
    </ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Variations:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Add White Wine:</strong> Add ¼ cup of white wine in step 3, sautéing for a few minutes to let it cook down a little.
</li><br>
    <li><strong>Add Veggies:</strong> Toss in some asparagus and cherry tomatoes.
</li><br>
    <li><strong>Zucchini Noodles:</strong> For a healthier twist, swap out the linguine for zucchini noodles.
</li><br>

     <h2 id="hamburger">Recipe #4 Hamburger and Fries</h2>
     
     <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/food/hamburger.png" alt="Cheese hamburger with french fries">
     
     
     <h2>How to Make a Perfect Hamburger:</h2>
       <p><strong>Make Seasoning</strong> by mixing all dry spices in a small bowl. Set aside.<br>
<br>
<strong>Form Patties:</strong> Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (they will shrink). <strong>Don’t over handle the meat.</strong> Touching the meat too much will make it tougher. Be very gentle shaping them, and be careful not to flatten them. Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.<br><br>

<strong>Grill:</strong> Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes (for medium rare), until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last minute of cooking.<br><br>

<strong>Serve:</strong> Place patties on a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings, and your favorite condiments like ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, Thousand island dressing, Ranch dressing, or homemade Chick-fil A Sauce. Enjoy with Coleslaw and Baked Beans!

        <li><strong>Condiments:</strong> ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, Thousand island dressing, Ranch dressing, or homemade Chick-fil A Sauce.</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make burger seasoning</strong> by combining all spices in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Form Patties:</strong> Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns, since the meat will shrink as it cooks. (Don't over-handle the meat, or it will make it tough).</li>
        <li><strong>Indent:</strong> Use your thumb to press a gentle indentation into the center of each patty, which will help them cook evenly and not puff up in the center. Cover and set aside while preheating grill. (Ice cube trick: Some chefs will put an ice cube on top of each indentation on the patties until they’re ready to cook, so they don't dry out.)</li>
        <li><strong>Grill:</strong> Preheat grill to medium high heat. Just before cooking, sprinkle burger seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> on top of burger patties during the last minute of cooking. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving on a bun, with desired toppings.
